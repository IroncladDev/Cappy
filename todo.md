### "Leftist Offensive" screen

A screen shows for the first time a user visits the site warning lefties that the site may be offensive.  About 99.5% of website visitors will click the button.

A black screen with a white foreground.  When the animation plays, a yellow gradient-like background hammers through.

 - Have two buttons as options
   - Bullet icon with "Bring it on"
   - Syringe icon with "Take it easy on me"
 - Depending on the button click, show:
   - "BASED" for the bullet
   - "Brace yourself, bub" for the syringe
 - Animation
   - A brass knuckle speeds across 1/3 of the screen from the right
   - The respective text slides across the screen
   - Upon reaching the first third, a CSS gradient shockwave ripples the screen and a deep depth charge sound effect plays (NOT SO LOUD)
   - Everything in slow-motion for a second
   - Once the sound finishes, move on
